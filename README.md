These modules exist solely to replace modules that have been [accidentally removed from your Drupal site](https://www.drupal.org/docs/updating-drupal/troubleshooting-database-updates#s-manually-removing-a-missing-theme-or-module). Upon `updb` they disable themselves, automagically removing the missing module from your configuration.
